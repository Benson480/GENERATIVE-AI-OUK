# 🤖 GENERATIVE AI TRAINING – OPEN UNIVERSITY OF KENYA

Welcome to my **Generative AI Learning Journey** at the **Open University of Kenya (OUK)**.  
This repository documents my progress, experiments, and projects as I explore the world of **Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — the technology behind modern innovations like ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Stable Diffusion.

## 🧠 About the Course
The **Generative AI Course** introduces foundational and advanced concepts in machine intelligence that *creates*.  
The course covers theoretical, mathematical, and hands-on aspects of Generative AI, including:

- Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)  
- Natural Language Generation (NLG)  
- Image, Text, and Audio Generation  
- AI Ethics and Responsible Innovation  

---

## 💻 Programming Languages Used
This course uses **JASICA** and **JAC**, two experimental AI-oriented programming languages designed for:  
- **JASICA** → Symbolic and cognitive AI modeling  
- **JAC** → Neural computation and generative simulation  

These languages enable learners to build and test generative AI models interactively, combining logic, creativity, and computation.

## 🧩 Tools and Technologies
- **Python** (for ML integration and experimentation)
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
- **OpenAI API**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Cloud Platforms** (Google Colab, AWS, Azure)

---

## 📘 Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, I aim to:
1. Understand the theoretical foundations of Generative AI.  
2. Design and implement generative models using JASICA and JAC.  
3. Develop practical AI tools that generate text, images, and code.  
4. Promote ethical AI usage aligned with societal and academic values.
